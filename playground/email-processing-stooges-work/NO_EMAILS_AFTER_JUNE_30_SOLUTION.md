# Solution: No Emails Processing After June 30, 2025

## Problem Identified
Atlas_Email hasn't processed any emails since June 30, 2025 because it's configured to ONLY process spam/junk folders, not the main INBOX.

## Current Configuration (ONLY spam folders)
- **bobviolette@me.com**: ["Junk", "Deleted Items", "Deleted Messages"] ❌ NO INBOX
- **dertbv@gmail.com**: ["[Gmail]/Spam", "[Gmail]/Trash"] ❌ NO INBOX  
- **teamicbob@aol.com**: ["Bulk", "Bulk Mail", "Deleted Messages", "Trash"] ❌ NO INBOX
- **tnlhassell@comcast.net**: ["Archive", "Trash", "Junk", "Drafts", "INBOX"] ✅ HAS INBOX

## Solution: Add INBOX to Target Folders

### Option 1: Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to http://localhost:8001
2. Navigate to Account Configuration
3. For each account, add "INBOX" to the target folders list

### Option 2: CLI Menu
1. Run Atlas_Email CLI
2. Choose option 1: Configuration Management
3. Update target folders for each account

### Option 3: Direct Database Update
```sql
-- Example for Gmail account
UPDATE accounts 
SET target_folders = '["INBOX", "[Gmail]/Spam", "[Gmail]/Trash"]'
WHERE email = 'dertbv@gmail.com';

-- Example for iCloud account  
UPDATE accounts
SET target_folders = '["INBOX", "Junk", "Deleted Items", "Deleted Messages"]'
WHERE email = 'bobviolette@me.com';
```

## Expected Result
Once INBOX is added to target folders, Atlas_Email will:
- Process new emails from the inbox
- Apply geographic intelligence to them
- Show emails with July 2025 timestamps
- Continue processing both inbox and spam folders

## Additional Note
The system is working correctly - it's just configured for spam cleanup only. No processing errors or bugs are preventing operation.
