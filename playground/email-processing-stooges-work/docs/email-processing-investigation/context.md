# Email Processing Investigation Context

**Task**: Investigate and resolve Atlas_Email processing issues: geographic intelligence regression and timestamp problems
**Repo path**: /Users/Badman/Desktop/email/playground/email-processing-stooges-work  
**Desired parallelism**: 0 (sequential - act as all three in order)

## Critical Symptoms
✅ Working: Emails being processed (count increasing 7,780→7,829)  
✅ Working: Classification functioning (user sees categories)
✅ Working: Email removal from server working
❌ BROKEN: Geographic intelligence (recent emails show IP: None, Country: None)
❌ BROKEN: Timestamps (emails getting June 30th dates instead of July 3rd)

## Context
494 older emails HAVE geographic data (system was working), recent emails have NO geographic data (regression occurred). Template agent recently modified app.py from 5,604 to 2,743 lines.

## Required Deliverables
1. Root cause analysis of both regression issues
2. Specific technical solutions for geographic intelligence restoration  
3. Timestamp correction implementation plan
4. Prevention strategy for future regressions
5. Quality evaluation with implementation roadmap (score ≥90)

## Target Score
90 (minimum acceptance threshold)

## Investigation Focus Areas
- Geographic intelligence pipeline analysis
- Timestamp processing workflow examination  
- Recent template agent modifications impact assessment
- System regression prevention strategies
