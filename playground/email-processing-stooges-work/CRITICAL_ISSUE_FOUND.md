# CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND - Dashboard Not Showing New Emails

## The Problem
1. You processed 167 emails today (July 2)
2. Email count DID increase (7861 â†’ 7865) 
3. But dashboard still shows June 30 emails
4. Error in webapp.log: `too many values to unpack (expected 6)`

## Root Cause
The geographic intelligence fix created a mismatch:
- Database logger now expects 7 values (includes geo_data)
- But email_processor.py still sends 6-value tuples
- This breaks the preview/display functionality

## Evidence from webapp.log
```
Line 140: [23:34:20] INFO: Error in process_folder_messages ([Gmail]/Trash): too many values to unpack (expected 6)
```

This error occurs when trying to process emails for display, preventing new emails from showing up.

## Why June 30 Emails Still Show
- Those emails were processed BEFORE the geographic fix
- They have the old 6-value tuple structure
- New emails with 7-value structure can't be displayed due to tuple unpacking error

## Immediate Fix Required
Update email_processor.py to include geo_data as the 7th element in ALL tuples:
1. messages_to_delete tuple creation
2. All tuple unpacking locations
3. All log_email_action calls

Without this fix, newly processed emails won't display in the dashboard even though they're being stored in the database.
