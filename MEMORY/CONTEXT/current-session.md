# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- ❌ **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Hard reset lost user's 4 hours of afternoon/evening work 
- ✅ Performance optimizations rolled back (per user request)
- ✅ Database restored from backup (mail_filter_backup_20250704_210132.db)
- ✅ Fixed syntax and import errors in email_processor.py and category_classifier.py
- ✅ Fixed dashboard sqlite3.Row .get() attribute errors
- ✅ Restored dashboard SQL fixes (new_category → primary_category)

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- **Extremely frustrated** about lost work from hard reset
- Had been working for 4 hours this afternoon/evening on improvements
- Work from morning (management pages) is preserved, but recent work is gone
- System should now be functional again after fixes

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Assess what functionality was lost and needs to be recreated
2. Ensure dashboard and all pages are working properly
3. Determine if any critical work can be recovered
4. Implement any missing features that were worked on today
5. Establish better backup/commit practices going forward

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: System restored to working state but lost recent uncommitted work
- **Performance optimizations**: Rolled back completely per user request
- **Dashboard**: Fixed sqlite3.Row errors, should be functional now
- **Database**: Restored to pre-performance state with backup

## Key Discoveries
- **Hard reset without checking git status destroyed uncommitted work**
- sqlite3.Row objects don't have .get() method - need bracket notation
- Database column is primary_category not new_category
- Must always check for uncommitted changes before any destructive git operations
