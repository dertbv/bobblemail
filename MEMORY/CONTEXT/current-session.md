# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- âœ… Implemented KISS spam pipeline optimization (15-20% performance gain)
- âœ… Created comprehensive classifier configuration system plan
- âœ… Deployed 6-agent system to implement classifier configuration
- âœ… Deployed Three Stooges to analyze/evaluate the plan
- ðŸ”§ Cleaned up old database files (renamed to .old, confirmed mail_filter.db is active)

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Wants classifier configuration system with toggle on/off and drag-drop reordering
- Plans require both web UI and CLI support with database changes
- Implementation must be incremental without breaking existing functionality

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Monitor agent progress on classifier configuration implementation
2. Review Three Stooges analysis of the plan for risks/improvements
3. Begin Phase 1: Database schema for configuration storage
4. Create feature flag system for safe rollout
5. Refactor classifiers into modular components

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Pipeline optimized (ML first, skip domain validation for 90%+ confidence)
- **Classifier Config**: Plan created, agents implementing, stooges analyzing
- **Database**: Confirmed mail_filter.db is only active DB, others renamed .old
- **Active Agents**: 6-agent system + Three Stooges both working autonomously

## Key Discoveries
- **Performance**: Reordering pipeline + confidence-based skipping = 15-20% faster
- **Database**: Multiple .db files were legacy - only mail_filter.db is used
- **Architecture**: Need modular classifiers for dynamic configuration
- **Safety**: Feature flags essential for incremental rollout
