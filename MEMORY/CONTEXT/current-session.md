# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- ✅ Successfully tested multi-agent communication POC with Three Stooges
- ✅ Created HTTP message broker for agent coordination
- ✅ Cleaned up git repository - reduced from 86 to 3 branches
- ✅ Fixed Claude Squad config for auto-permissions

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Excited about multi-agent orchestration possibilities
- Testing parallel agent communication systems
- Cleaned up 236 uncommitted file changes (not branches as initially thought)

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Clean up 34 straggler categories into 4-category system
2. Integrate delete_dupes.py for automatic cleanup
3. Review and commit the 30+ uncommitted file changes
4. Explore multi-agent system enhancements
5. Document the POC architecture

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Template system 100% complete, all routes converted
- **Multi-Agent POC**: Message broker running, dashboard created, agents communicating
- **Claude Squad**: Config updated for --dangerously-skip-permissions

## Key Discoveries
- **Multi-agent communication works**: Agents can coordinate via HTTP message broker
- **Claude Squad limitations**: Requires git repo, interactive TUI, not scriptable
- **Git cleanup success**: Removed 83 empty branches, repository now clean
- **VS Code confusion**: 236 was file changes, not branches
