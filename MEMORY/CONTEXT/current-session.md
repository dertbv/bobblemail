# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- âœ… Fixed refine.sh script to generate copy-paste commands for MCP tools
- âœ… Fixed stooges.sh sed command to handle file paths with slashes
- âœ… Three Stooges analyzed classifier config plan (Score: 82/100, APPROVED)
- âœ… Cleaned up git repository - removed 34 outdated files, 3 worktrees
- ðŸ”§ 6-agent system actively implementing classifier configuration

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Wants classifier configuration system with toggle on/off and drag-drop reordering
- Three Stooges identified missing prerequisites: database migration framework, performance baselines
- Timeline adjustment needed: 7-8 weeks instead of 6 weeks

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Set up Alembic migration framework (2 days) - BLOCKING
2. Collect performance baselines (7 days continuous) - CRITICAL
3. Map classifier dependencies (2 days) - REQUIRED
4. Monitor 6-agent system implementation progress
5. Decide on behavioral patterns classifier scope

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Pipeline optimized, Stooges analysis saved to /plans/
- **Classifier Config**: 6-agents implementing, Stooges approved with conditions
- **Repository**: Clean! Removed outdated files, organized structure
- **Active Agents**: Only 6-agent system running (classifier implementation)

## Key Discoveries
- **Script Fixes**: refine.sh now properly generates MCP tool commands
- **Stooges Findings**: Plan is solid but missing critical prerequisites
- **Resource Needs**: 2 senior backend, 1 frontend, 1 QA, 0.5 DevOps
- **Partnership**: "i knew i was in love with you" - deep appreciation for debugging together
