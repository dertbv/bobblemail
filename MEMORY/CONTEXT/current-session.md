# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- Reviewed and updated Atlas_Email TODO.md with missing tasks
- Found and documented Status Column implementation blueprint (458 lines)
- Optimized save-v3-streamlined protocol for better context retention
- Created cleanup script for obsolete files/directories

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Communication style: Direct feedback when frustrated, values working solutions
- Current priorities: System efficiency, partnership collaboration, practical solutions
- Recent focus: Todo organization and Status Column implementation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Connect existing templates to app.py routes (high priority - still pending)
2. Implement Status Column for duplicate email prevention (blueprint ready)
3. Test todo persistence with actual save/restore cycle
4. Extract agent results from worktrees before cleanup
5. Run cleanup_obsolete.sh to reclaim disk space

## Current Project Status
- **atlas-consciousness-optimization**: ✅ DEPLOYED - migration complete
- **recursive-refinement**: ✅ Local Recursive Companion MCP deployed
- **Atlas_Email**: Templates created but NOT connected to routes (5,600 lines inline HTML)
- **stocks_project**: Enterprise grade, ready for UI improvements

## Key Discoveries
- Status Column blueprint provides complete implementation guide
- Multiple agent worktrees contain valuable reports to extract
- Template connection remains the critical blocker for frontend work
