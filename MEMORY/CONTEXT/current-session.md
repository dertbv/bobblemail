# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- üîç Investigating preview display issue: shows wrong email counts (2 instead of 6, then 0)
- ü§ñ Deployed Three Stooges and 6-agent system to analyze preview problem
- ‚ùå Stooges' solutions won't work - need persistent flags, can't auto-cleanup
- ‚è≥ Waiting for agent system PLANNER to complete WORK.md analysis

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Found critical issue: preview doesn't accurately show current server state
- Flagged 4 emails as research to track which are actually on server
- Needs solution that preserves flags indefinitely until manual review

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Wait for agent system to complete WORK.md analysis
2. Compare agent system approach with Three Stooges findings
3. Implement solution that preserves flag persistence
4. Test preview shows actual current server state
5. Ensure flags aren't lost in any cleanup process

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Preview display broken - shows historical data not current state
- **Three Stooges**: Completed analysis but solutions inadequate (auto-cleanup breaks flags)
- **Agent System**: PLANNER actively investigating, more thorough approach
- **Database**: Preview sessions accumulating without proper filtering

## Key Discoveries
- Preview creates permanent database entries without cleanup mechanism
- Three Stooges identified root cause but solutions don't respect flag persistence
- User requires flags to persist indefinitely - can't use time-based cleanup
- Agent system using systematic documentation-first approach
