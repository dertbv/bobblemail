# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- âœ… Merged template agent work - app.py reduced from 5,740 to 2,745 lines
- âœ… Six Agent System completed 4-category classification implementation
- ðŸš€ Deployed classifier-deployment-agent to finish production deployment
- ðŸš€ Deployed web-interface-agents for complete UI/UX overhaul

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Kicked Six Agent System back into action when they stalled
- Wants web interface with consistent borders, mobile support, management pages
- Values completed deployments over partial implementations

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Monitor classifier-deployment-agent completing 4-category deployment
2. Monitor web-interface-agents building new UI pages
3. Merge 4-category classification to main branch
4. Test auto warranty fix in production
5. Deploy delete_dupes.py integration

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Two parallel deployments active (classification + web interface)
- **Template System**: FIXED - all routes now use templates.TemplateResponse()
- **Agent Systems**: 2 active (classifier deployment + web interface overhaul)

## Key Discoveries
- Six Agent System created implementation but didn't deploy (needed push)
- Template blocker resolved - frontend work now unblocked
- Web interface needs complete overhaul for consistency and mobile support
