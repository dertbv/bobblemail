# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- ✅ Fixed dashboard/analytics to display correct 4-category system
- ✅ Swapped databases - root mail_filter.db (better) replaced scrambled data/mail_filter.db
- ✅ Analytics improvements: Geographic Intelligence limited to top 10, popup shows pie chart
- ✅ Git cleanup: removed old playground files, archived consolidation SQL

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Identified database classifications were completely scrambled after agent consolidation
- Found legitimate companies (Experian) scattered across threat categories
- Swapped to better database with reasonable distribution

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Clean up 34 straggler categories (Brand Impersonation, Payment Scam, etc.)
2. Build ML reclassification tool using Naive Bayes + Random Forest
3. Implement legitimacy scoring without whitelists
4. Test geographic intelligence pie charts work correctly
5. Verify all web interface sections display proper data

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Database restored with proper 4-category distribution
- **Dashboard**: Now shows actual categories with correct icons/counts
- **Analytics**: Geographic popup converted to subcategory pie charts
- **Database**: Using root mail_filter.db (7,313 emails, better distribution)

## Key Discoveries
- **Two databases existed**: root (good) vs data/ (scrambled by agents)
- **Distribution now reasonable**: Commercial Spam 35%, Legitimate 26%, Dangerous 22%, Scams 16%
- **Both CLI and web point to data/mail_filter.db** - successfully swapped
- **Companion suggested comprehensive ML repair strategy** - no whitelists, pure ML classification
