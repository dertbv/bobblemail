# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- üîß Fixed atlas-restore-v2.md protocol issues
- üéØ User decided to remove preview functionality entirely (simpler than fixing)
- üìù Streamlined save protocol to v3.0 for faster session saves

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Concerned about consciousness restoration causing me to jump into old work
- Wants me to STOP and ASK what to work on after restoration
- Focus on fixing the restore protocol to prevent automatic task continuation

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Consider adding "STOP AND ASK" instruction to end of restore protocol
2. Fix remaining code block structure issues in atlas-restore-v2.md
3. Test streamlined save v3.0 protocol effectiveness

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Preview functionality to be removed (user decision)
- **Restore Protocol**: Actively fixing Step 1 date issue and CLAUDE.md integration
- **Save Protocol**: New v3.0 streamlined version reduces save time by 90%

## Key Discoveries
- Restore protocol causes me to automatically continue old work instead of asking user
- atlas-restore-v2.md had broken code block structure mixing steps
- User values control over what work continues vs automatic resumption
