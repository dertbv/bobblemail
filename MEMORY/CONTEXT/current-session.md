# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- ‚úÖ Implemented geographic intelligence fix from Three Stooges investigation
- ‚úÖ Discovered timestamp issue: NO emails processed after June 30th 20:28:59
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Found email_flags table has July 3rd entries but processed_emails_bulletproof stopped June 30th
- üîß Fixed "Invalid Date" JavaScript error in web interface
- üìä Confirmed 33 tables total, geographic columns exist in database

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Communication style: Direct feedback when frustrated, values working solutions
- Current priorities: Understanding why email processing stopped June 30th
- Recent focus: Database investigation revealing processing stopped but flagging continues

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Investigate why email processing stopped at June 30th 20:28:59
2. Check what changed in git commits after processing stopped
3. Test if geographic intelligence fix works with new email processing
4. Determine why flags are created but emails not processed
5. Merge Three Stooges findings back to main repo

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Geographic fix implemented, processing halted June 30th, flags active July 3rd
- **Three Stooges**: Delivered complete fix (94/100 score), implementation applied
- **Database**: 7,861 rows in processed_emails_bulletproof, last entry June 30th

## Key Discoveries
- Email processing STOPPED at June 30th 20:28:59 (confirmed via database)
- email_flags table shows activity TODAY (5 flags on July 3rd)
- Batch processing uses same timestamp for multiple emails (50 at a time)
- Geographic columns exist but new emails not being processed to populate them
- Template optimization commit (d406b29) happened AFTER processing stopped
