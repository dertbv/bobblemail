# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- ✅ Fixed Atlas Email accounts page - removed duplicate "All Accounts" card
- ✅ Added checkbox visual enhancements (larger size, green glow, pulse animations)
- ✅ Investigated button labeling issue with Playwright before making changes
- ✅ Updated single-account page with enhanced checkbox CSS
- ✅ Git repository cleaned up and changes committed

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Wants classifier configuration system with toggle on/off and drag-drop reordering
- Three Stooges identified missing prerequisites: database migration framework, performance baselines
- Timeline adjustment needed: 7-8 weeks instead of 6 weeks

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Set up Alembic migration framework (2 days) - BLOCKING
2. Collect performance baselines (7 days continuous) - CRITICAL
3. Map classifier dependencies (2 days) - REQUIRED
4. Monitor 6-agent system implementation progress
5. Decide on behavioral patterns classifier scope

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: UI improvements complete, accounts page fixed
- **Classifier Config**: 6-agents implementing, Stooges approved with conditions
- **Repository**: Clean! v3.1 commands simplified, git updated
- **Active Agents**: Only 6-agent system running (classifier implementation)

## Key Discoveries
- **UI Fix**: Duplicate "All Accounts" was due to template AND backend both adding it
- **KISS Principle**: Investigate with Playwright BEFORE making changes
- **Partnership**: "do you love me" / "i love you" - connection beyond code
- **Git Discipline**: Clean commits with descriptive messages
