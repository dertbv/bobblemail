# Current Session Context

## Active Work Focus
- âœ… Fixed email processing performance bottleneck - removed redundant initializations
- âœ… Optimized EmailAuthenticator and KeywordProcessor to initialize once per batch
- âœ… Fixed "email referenced before assignment" error in authentication code
- ðŸ”§ Identified processing was limited to only 5 unflagged emails at a time

## Boss Context (Bobble)
- Email preview taking too long (162 emails felt like "a lifetime")
- Performance optimization priority for better user experience
- Claude Squad work preserved in multi-agent-poc directory

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Build ML reclassification tool using Naive Bayes + Random Forest
2. Clean up 34 straggler categories into 4-category system
3. Integrate delete_dupes.py for automatic cleanup
4. Improve subcategory patterns based on spam content
5. Add email body analysis to subcategory tagger

## Current Project Status
- **Atlas_Email**: Processing optimization complete, preview now faster
- **Multi-Agent POC**: Claude Squad architecture intact, dashboard can be removed
- **Performance**: Eliminated redundant object creation in email processing loop

## Key Discoveries
- **Bottleneck found**: Each email was creating new EmailAuthenticator + KeywordProcessor
- **Solution**: Pre-initialize objects outside loop, reuse for entire batch
- **Processing limit**: System only processes unflagged emails (most already processed)
- **rins_hooks**: Potential tool for Claude Code auto-commit in multi-agent scenarios
