# Transactional Email Classification System - Implementation Summary

## System Overview

Multi-tier email classification system that distinguishes between spam promotional emails and legitimate business communications.

### Email Categories

1. **Transactional Email** - Order confirmations, receipts, statements, shipping notifications
2. **Account Notification** - Security alerts, password resets, account updates  
3. **Subscription Management** - Terms changes, service updates, subscription renewals
4. **Promotional Email** (refined) - Pure marketing/sales content only

### Architecture Changes

#### 1. Enhanced Classification Functions (`spam_classifier.py`)

Added three new detection functions:
- `is_transactional_email()` - Detects receipts, orders, billing, confirmations
- `is_account_notification()` - Detects security alerts, password resets
- `is_subscription_management()` - Detects terms changes, service updates

**Key Features:**
- Advanced keyword matching with confidence scoring
- Business email prefix detection (receipts@, billing@, no_reply@, etc.)
- Legitimate domain validation
- Promotional language exclusion to avoid false positives

#### 2. Priority-Based Classification (`keyword_processor.py`)

Updated classification order:
1. **User-protected patterns** (highest priority)
2. **Community emails** (neighborhood communications)
3. **Transactional emails** (business transactions) - **NEW**
4. **Account notifications** (security alerts) - **NEW** 
5. **Subscription management** (service updates) - **NEW**
6. **Spam categories** (phishing, scams, etc.)
7. **Promotional emails** (marketing content)

#### 3. Updated Processing Logic (`email_processor.py`)

Modified preservation logic to protect essential business communications:
- Preserve: `Transactional Email`, `Account Notification`, `Subscription Management`
- Delete: `Promotional Email`, `Marketing Spam`, other spam categories

#### 4. Enhanced Two-Factor Validator (`two_factor_email_validator.py`)

Added transactional content detection before promotional classification to ensure business communications are properly categorized.

#### 5. Comprehensive Keyword Database

Added 42 new keywords across three categories:
- **Transactional Email**: receipt, invoice, statement, order confirmation, shipping, etc.
- **Account Notification**: password reset, security alert, account verification, etc.
- **Subscription Management**: terms changing, service update, auto-renewal, etc.
