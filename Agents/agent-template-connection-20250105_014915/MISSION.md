# Template Connection Completion Mission

## Agent: Template Connection Specialist

### Primary Objective
Complete the template system implementation by connecting the remaining 4 routes in app.py to their existing template files.

### Specific Tasks

1. **Connect `/accounts` route**
   - Find the route handler in app.py (currently using f-strings)
   - Convert to use `templates.TemplateResponse("pages/accounts.html", context)`
   - Ensure all data is passed in context dictionary
   - Test functionality remains identical

2. **Connect `/timer` route**
   - Locate timer route handler
   - Convert inline HTML to use `templates.TemplateResponse("pages/timer.html", context)`
   - Preserve all JavaScript functionality and data passing

3. **Connect `/validate` route**
   - Find validation route handler
   - Convert to use `templates.TemplateResponse("pages/validate.html", context)`
   - Maintain all validation logic and results display

4. **Connect `/single-account/{account_id}` route**
   - Locate single account detail handler
   - Convert to use `templates.TemplateResponse("pages/single_account.html", context)`
   - Ensure account_id and all account data properly passed

### Technical Requirements

- Use the same pattern as existing template connections:
  ```python
  return templates.TemplateResponse(
      request=request,
      name="pages/[template_name].html",
      context={
          "request": request,
          # ... all other data
      }
  )
  ```

- Preserve ALL functionality - this is a refactoring, not a rewrite
- Ensure all JavaScript, CSS, and dynamic content continues working
- Test each converted route to verify identical behavior

### Success Criteria

1. All 4 routes converted to use templates
2. app.py has NO remaining inline HTML generation (no more f-string HTML)
3. All functionality preserved exactly as before
4. Clean git commit with descriptive message

### Autonomous Authority
You have full authority to make all necessary code changes. Proceed with confidence and complete the entire task without waiting for approval. Use your best judgment to handle any edge cases.

Remember: This is purely a refactoring task - the templates already exist and just need to be connected properly.
