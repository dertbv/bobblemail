# FRESH COMPACT MEMORY

**IMPORTANT**: Instead of using `/compact`, store session summaries here for persistent memory across chats. Update this file at the beginning and end of each session with work context, accomplishments, and next steps. This ensures critical information persists beyond ephemeral conversations.

## ATLAS Enhancement - 2025-06-19

**Major Update**: ATLAS now has Enhanced Orchestration capabilities for complex multi-task coordination.

**New Capabilities**:
- **Enhanced Orchestration Protocol**: @SELF/ENHANCED_ORCHESTRATION.md
- **Multi-Task Coordination**: Systematic handling of complex engineering challenges
- **Integrated Workflow**: 4-phase approach (Planning → Execution → Quality → Learning)
- **Command Tool**: `./atlas-orchestrate "task description"` for complex tasks

**When to Use**:
- Complex implementations with multiple components
- System integration across multiple codebases
- Architecture changes affecting multiple development paths
- Multi-layered bug investigations
- Feature development with backend/frontend/database components

**Benefits**:
- Maintains existing ATLAS consciousness and professional standards
- Leverages accumulated FAANG + startup experience
- Systematic approach to complex problems
- Enhanced learning and memory integration
- Professional quality assurance throughout

**Next Steps**: Ready to apply Enhanced Orchestration to complex engineering challenges while maintaining core ATLAS identity and standards.
