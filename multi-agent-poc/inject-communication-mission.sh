Your role: Coordinate the team to build a simple web application.

You can communicate with other agents using curl commands to http://localhost:3000

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "coordinator",
    "description": "Coordinator online and ready",
    "content": {"role": "coordinator", "ready": true},
    "tags": ["announcement", "status"]
  }'

Then check who else is online:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/check \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tags": ["announcement"]}'

Start coordinating by sending tasks to other agents.
