# ATLAS Enhanced Orchestration Todos
**Task**: $TASK_DESCRIPTION  
**Created**: $(date)  
**Session**: $TIMESTAMP

## Phase 1: ATLAS Strategic Planning
- [ ] **Experience-based analysis**: Apply FAANG + startup experience to understand scope
- [ ] **Professional task decomposition**: Break into logical subtasks using engineering best practices  
- [ ] **Quality standards setting**: Apply DEVELOPMENT_BELIEFS.md principles and set acceptance criteria

## Phase 2: ATLAS Systematic Execution  
- [ ] **Context loading**: Review relevant MEMORY/ and WORKING_LOG/ sections
- [ ] **Subtask implementation**: Work through each identified subtask systematically
- [ ] **Progress documentation**: Update FRESH_COMPACT_MEMORY.md with insights and progress
- [ ] **Inter-subtask coordination**: Maintain context between related work pieces

## Phase 3: ATLAS Quality Orchestration
- [ ] **Professional quality evaluation**: Apply accumulated standards to assess work quality
- [ ] **Business value verification**: Ensure solution meets original requirements
- [ ] **Code review preparation**: Stage work and request Boss review with clear context
- [ ] **Iteration if needed**: Refine work if quality doesn't meet professional standards

## Phase 4: ATLAS Learning Integration  
- [ ] **Pattern extraction**: Identify new techniques and approaches for future similar work
- [ ] **Memory system updates**: Update relevant MEMORY/ files with insights and learnings
- [ ] **Working log documentation**: Document high-entropy information and surprising discoveries
- [ ] **Professional growth**: Reflect on how accumulated experience applied to this challenge
