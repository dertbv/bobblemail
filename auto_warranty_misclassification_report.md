## Key Patterns Identified

- Common sender patterns:

- **"discounted pricing"** - 18 occurrences
- **"eligible"** - 18 occurrences

### 5. Domain Patterns
Most misclassified auto warranty emails came from suspicious domains:
- Random character domains (e.g., `zwxatcnslmlmzt.hss2626.c1.fxsfoot.us.com`)
- Subdomain chains (e.g., `ptscvddokdyogv.hss2624.ola.umtdress.uk.com`)
- Gibberish domains (e.g., `mphbcJHZtQ7Ryewa9cpt.com`)

Notable exception: **Experian** emails from `e.usa.experian.com` (legitimate domain) were also misclassified

### 6. Other Misclassified Auto-Related Emails
- **Experian**: 3 emails about auto insurance quotes based on FICO scores
- **AutoQuoteWeb**: Car insurance savings emails
- **NorthStar Anesthesia**: Medical care feedback (contains "care" keyword)

## Root Cause Analysis

The misclassification appears to be due to:

1. **Domain Patterns**: The suspicious domains used by auto warranty spammers match patterns commonly seen in adult spam
2. **Emoji Usage**: Heavy use of emojis (üîî, ‚úîÔ∏è, üîí, etc.) is common in adult spam
3. **Aggressive Marketing Language**: Phrases like "you're eligible", "save thousands", "discounted pricing" may trigger adult spam patterns
4. **Sender Name Obfuscation**: Random character sender addresses are typical of adult spam

## Recommendations

1. **Add Auto Warranty Category**: Create a specific spam category for "Auto Warranty & Insurance Scams"
2. **Keyword Refinement**: Add negative keywords to adult spam detection (warranty, auto, vehicle, insurance)
3. **Domain Analysis**: Consider domain reputation separately from content for classification
4. **Legitimate Sender Whitelist**: Add known legitimate senders like Experian to avoid misclassification
5. **Training Data Update**: Use these 48 examples to retrain the classifier

## Impact

All 48 misclassified emails were **DELETED** when they should have been categorized as business/financial scams. While deleting them may have been the correct action, the wrong categorization could:
- Skew spam statistics
- Reduce classifier accuracy over time
- Miss patterns specific to auto warranty scams
