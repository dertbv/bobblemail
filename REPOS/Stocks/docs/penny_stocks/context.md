# Penny Stock Analysis Context

## Task Objective
Build a comprehensive penny stock analysis tool that identifies the top 10 penny stocks with the greatest potential to rise in the next 30 days, with detailed rationale for each selection.

## Definition of Penny Stocks

- Exclude stocks with market caps below $1M (to avoid pump-and-dump schemes)

## Analysis Criteria
1. **Technical Indicators**
   - Recent price momentum and volume patterns
   - Support and resistance levels
   - Moving averages (10, 20, 50-day)
   - RSI, MACD, and other momentum indicators

2. **Fundamental Factors**
   - Revenue growth trends
   - Earnings reports and guidance
   - Debt-to-equity ratios
   - Cash flow and liquidity

3. **Market Sentiment**
