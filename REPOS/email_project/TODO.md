# TODO - Email Project Refactoring

## Priority 1 - Must Fix This Sprint ⚡

- [ ] **Refactor Monolithic main.py (1,311 lines)** - Violates single responsibility principle
  - Split into MenuHandler, ProcessingController, ConfigurationManager modules
  - Target: main.py -> MenuHandler -> ProcessingController -> EmailProcessor

- [ ] **Fix Configuration Sprawl** - 5 separate JSON files create maintenance nightmare
  - Consolidate into single configuration system with nested sections
  - Implement centralized settings.py with environment variable support

- [ ] **Resolve Import Complexity** - Deep dependency chains between modules
  - Restructure import hierarchy to eliminate circular dependencies
  - Implement dependency injection pattern where appropriate

## Priority 2 - Next Month 📈

- [ ] **Add Deployment Strategy** - Missing containerization/CI-CD
  - Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
  - Set up basic CI/CD pipeline
  - Document deployment process

- [ ] **Implement Monitoring** - No health checks or performance metrics
  - Add system health check endpoints
  - Implement ML prediction latency tracking
  - Set up basic alerting for failures

- [ ] **Address Scalability Ceiling** - SQLite won't scale beyond single user
  - Design database abstraction layer for future PostgreSQL migration
  - Plan horizontal scaling strategy
  - Document scaling roadmap

## Architecture Improvements 🏗️

- [ ] **Implement Proper Module Structure**

  email_project/
  ├── core/processors/     # Email processing logic
  ├── core/classifiers/    # ML classification
  ├── core/providers/      # Provider-specific code
  ├── web/api/            # FastAPI routes
  ├── web/models/         # Request/response models
  ├── data/database/      # Database layer
  ├── data/migrations/    # Schema migrations
  └── config/settings.py  # Centralized configuration
  ```

- [ ] **Add API Documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] **Implement Load Testing** - Validate system under stress
- [ ] **Add Performance Monitoring** - Track system performance metrics

## Notes

- Current system achieves 95.6%+ ML accuracy - preserve during refactoring
- Architecture patterns (Repository, Strategy, Observer) are well-implemented
- Focus on organizational cleanup rather than fundamental redesign
- Tech Lead assessment: B+ (83/100) - Production ready with refinement needed
