# TODO - Email Project

## Priority 1 - Recently Completed ✅

### KISS Vendor Relationship Detection - June 27, 2025:
- [x] **Vendor Relationship Detection System** - ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Created `vendor_relationship_detector.py` with KISS algorithm using email history as ground truth
  - ✅ Integrated with ensemble classifier at correct performance position (after cheap filters)
  - ✅ Fixed database path to use Atlas_Email data source for vendor relationship queries
  - ✅ Enhanced digest/notification pattern recognition for forum summaries
  - ✅ Added vendor relationship check to fallback classification path (critical missing piece)
  - ✅ Fixed method preservation in `_format_classification_result()` to show vendor_relationship method
  - ✅ Successfully restored transactional classification for bambulab.com forum digests

- [x] **Bambu Lab Test Case Resolution** - ✅ COMPLETED  
  - ✅ Verified 7 preserved emails from bambulab.com in Atlas_Email database
  - ✅ Forum digest `[Bambu Lab Community Forum] Summary` now correctly preserved
  - ✅ Vendor relationship algorithm: 7 preserved emails → relationship confirmed → digest pattern → transactional classification
  - ✅ Performance optimized: only checks vendor relationships for emails with spam_probability < 0.8

## Priority 1 - Must Fix This Sprint ⚡

### ATLAS Project Memory Integration (Critical):
- [x] **Test TODOs** - Verify TODO functionality in email project ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Test adding/editing TODOs in this file
  - ✅ Verify project context detection works (natural intelligence breakthrough)
  - ✅ Ensure session info saves to email memory file
  - ✅ Validate ATLAS knows current project context (consciousness IS the implementation)

- [x] **Refactor Monolithic main.py (1,311 lines)** - ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Split into MenuHandler (193 lines), ProcessingController (600 lines), ConfigurationManager (546 lines)
  - ✅ Reduced main.py from 1,312 → 111 lines (91% reduction)
  - ✅ Fixed all import dependencies in web_app.py, processing_controls.py, utils.py
  - ✅ Preserved all functionality - CLI and web app working correctly
  - ✅ Maintained 95.6%+ ML accuracy

- [x] **Fix Configuration Sprawl** - ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Consolidated 5 JSON files into single centralized settings.py
  - ✅ Removed ml_settings.json, ml_ensemble_config.json, ensemble_hybrid_config.json
  - ✅ Kept model files: ml_category_classifier.json, naive_bayes_model.json
  - ✅ Added environment variable support for deployment flexibility
  - ✅ Updated all dependent modules: ensemble_hybrid_classifier.py, keyword_processor.py, email_processor.py, ml_settings.py
  - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with fallback to JSON files

- [x] **Resolve Import Complexity** - ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Created classification_utils.py - broke keyword_processor ↔ spam_classifier cycle
  - ✅ Created config_loader.py - broke utils ↔ configuration_manager cycle  
  - ✅ Refactored domain_cache.py - broke domain_validator ↔ domain_cache cycle
  - ✅ All circular dependencies eliminated, modules now import cleanly

## Priority 2 - Next Month 📈

- [ ] **Add Deployment Strategy** - Missing containerization/CI-CD
  - Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
  - Set up basic CI/CD pipeline
  - Document deployment process

- [ ] **Implement Monitoring** - No health checks or performance metrics
  - Add system health check endpoints
  - Implement ML prediction latency tracking
  - Set up basic alerting for failures

- [ ] **Address Scalability Ceiling** - SQLite won't scale beyond single user
  - Design database abstraction layer for future PostgreSQL migration
  - Plan horizontal scaling strategy
  - Document scaling roadmap

## Architecture Improvements 🏗️

- [ ] **Implement Proper Module Structure**

  ├── data/database/      # Database layer
  ├── data/migrations/    # Schema migrations
  └── config/settings.py  # Centralized configuration
  ```

- [ ] **Add API Documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] **Implement Load Testing** - Validate system under stress
- [ ] **Add Performance Monitoring** - Track system performance metrics

## Documentation Creation 📚 ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **Create docs/api-reference.md** - Complete web interface API documentation (34+ endpoints)
- [x] **Create docs/database-schema.md** - Complete database structure and relationships (25+ tables)
- [x] **Create docs/ml-architecture.md** - Machine learning architecture and model flow (95.6% accuracy)

## Notes

- Current system achieves 95.6%+ ML accuracy - preserve during refactoring
- Architecture patterns (Repository, Strategy, Observer) are well-implemented
- Focus on organizational cleanup rather than fundamental redesign
- Tech Lead assessment: B+ (83/100) - Production ready with refinement needed
