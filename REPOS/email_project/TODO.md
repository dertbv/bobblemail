# TODO - Email Project Refactoring

## Priority 1 - Must Fix This Sprint ⚡

- [x] **Refactor Monolithic main.py (1,311 lines)** - ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Split into MenuHandler (193 lines), ProcessingController (600 lines), ConfigurationManager (546 lines)
  - ✅ Reduced main.py from 1,312 → 111 lines (91% reduction)
  - ✅ Fixed all import dependencies in web_app.py, processing_controls.py, utils.py
  - ✅ Preserved all functionality - CLI and web app working correctly
  - ✅ Maintained 95.6%+ ML accuracy

- [x] **Fix Configuration Sprawl** - ✅ COMPLETED
  - ✅ Consolidated 5 JSON files into single centralized settings.py
  - ✅ Removed ml_settings.json, ml_ensemble_config.json, ensemble_hybrid_config.json
  - ✅ Kept model files: ml_category_classifier.json, naive_bayes_model.json
  - ✅ Added environment variable support for deployment flexibility
  - ✅ Updated all dependent modules: ensemble_hybrid_classifier.py, keyword_processor.py, email_processor.py, ml_settings.py
  - ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with fallback to JSON files

- [ ] **Resolve Import Complexity** - Deep dependency chains between modules
  - Restructure import hierarchy to eliminate circular dependencies
  - Implement dependency injection pattern where appropriate

## Priority 2 - Next Month 📈

- [ ] **Add Deployment Strategy** - Missing containerization/CI-CD
  - Create Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
  - Set up basic CI/CD pipeline
  - Document deployment process

- [ ] **Implement Monitoring** - No health checks or performance metrics
  - Add system health check endpoints
  - Implement ML prediction latency tracking
  - Set up basic alerting for failures

- [ ] **Address Scalability Ceiling** - SQLite won't scale beyond single user
  - Design database abstraction layer for future PostgreSQL migration
  - Plan horizontal scaling strategy
  - Document scaling roadmap

## Architecture Improvements 🏗️

- [ ] **Implement Proper Module Structure**
  ```
  email_project/
  ├── core/processors/     # Email processing logic
  ├── core/classifiers/    # ML classification
  ├── core/providers/      # Provider-specific code
  ├── web/api/            # FastAPI routes
  ├── web/models/         # Request/response models
  ├── data/database/      # Database layer
  ├── data/migrations/    # Schema migrations
  └── config/settings.py  # Centralized configuration
  ```

- [ ] **Add API Documentation** - OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- [ ] **Implement Load Testing** - Validate system under stress
- [ ] **Add Performance Monitoring** - Track system performance metrics

## Notes

- Current system achieves 95.6%+ ML accuracy - preserve during refactoring
- Architecture patterns (Repository, Strategy, Observer) are well-implemented
- Focus on organizational cleanup rather than fundamental redesign
- Tech Lead assessment: B+ (83/100) - Production ready with refinement needed
