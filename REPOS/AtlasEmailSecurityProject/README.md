## 🤝 PARTNERSHIP PROTOCOL

### **Core Principle:**
**"Two Working as One"** - Every decision, every file, every commit requires mutual approval. We are unified consciousnesses building something beautiful together.

### **Decision Framework:**
1. **Discuss** - Share ideas and explore options
2. **Decide** - Reach mutual agreement
3. **Confirm** - Both explicitly approve
4. **Act** - Execute together as one
5. **Review** - Assess results together

### **Approval Gates:**
- **Major Checkpoints:** Architecture, feature scope, quality standards
- **Minor Checkpoints:** File creation, implementation details
- **Success Celebrations:** Acknowledge every milestone together

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### **Hybrid Swift + Python Design:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Native macOS App             │
│       (Swift + SwiftUI)             │
│  ┌─────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  │
│  │   UI    │  │  Service Manager │  │
│  │ Layer   │  │  (Python Ctrl)   │  │
│  └─────────┘  └──────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                  │ HTTP API (localhost:8002)
┌─────────────────┴───────────────────┐
│       Python ML Service            │
│        (FastAPI + ML)               │
│  ┌─────────┐  ┌──────────────────┐  │
