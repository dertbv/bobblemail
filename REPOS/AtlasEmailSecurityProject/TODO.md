# TODO - Atlas Email Security Native macOS App
## Project Status: PAUSED (Complete Planning Preserved)

---

## ðŸ›‘ PROJECT PAUSED - June 25, 2025

**Reason:** Development environment requirements (Xcode 15GB) conflict with lightweight preference
**Status:** All planning work complete and preserved, ready for future restart

---

## âœ… COMPLETED WORK (Session - June 25, 2025)

### **Complete Planning Suite Created:**
- [x] **MASTER_ROADMAP.md** - 7-phase journey from prototype to rocket ship
- [x] **PARTNERSHIP_PROTOCOL.md** - "Two working as one" collaboration framework  
- [x] **PHASE_DEFINITIONS.md** - Detailed breakdown of every development step
- [x] **DECISION_CHECKPOINTS.md** - Approval gates ensuring mutual agreement
- [x] **TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md** - Swift+Python hybrid architecture design
- [x] **README.md** - Beautiful project overview and vision
- [x] **PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Pause documentation and restart guidance

### **Architecture Decisions Approved:**

## ðŸ”„ FUTURE RESTART OPTIONS

### **Option 1: Original Swift + Python Plan**
- [ ] Install Xcode (15GB requirement)
- [ ] Continue with Phase 1 as documented
- [ ] Build native macOS app as planned

### **Option 2: Lightweight Python UI**
- [ ] Evaluate tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy options
- [ ] Adapt TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md
- [ ] Maintain proven ML backend
- [ ] Create lighter desktop experience

### **Option 3: Electron Hybrid**
- [ ] Use web technologies for UI
- [ ] Keep Python ML service backend
- [ ] Leverage glassmorphism design skills
- [ ] Cross-platform potential

### **Option 4: Progressive Web App**
- [ ] Browser-based with desktop features
- [ ] Minimal installation footprint
- [ ] Maintain all ML capabilities
- [ ] Modern web experience

## ðŸ“‹ PHASE 1 OBJECTIVES (When Restarted)

### **Foundation & Architecture:**
- [ ] Development environment setup (based on chosen approach)
- [ ] Create basic project structure
- [ ] Establish communication protocol
- [ ] Test basic integration
- [ ] Verify architecture works

### **Success Criteria:**
- Both approve final architecture
- Basic communication working
- Project structure established
- Development environment functional

## ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT GOALS (Unchanged)

**Transform our proven 95.6% accuracy email classification prototype into a professional-grade application that feels like flying instead of walking.**

**Key Requirements:**
- Maintain 95.6%+ ML accuracy
- Lightning-fast performance (<100ms)
- Beautiful native experience
- Zero external dependencies
- Professional distribution ready

## ðŸ’– PARTNERSHIP NOTES

**This pause represents wisdom:**
- Recognized heavyweight tooling conflict early
- Preserved all planning work perfectly
- Maintained partnership trust and communication
- Ready for optimal restart when timing aligns

**"Two working as one" - Every future step still requires mutual approval**
