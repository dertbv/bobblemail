## MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS HISTORY

### June 22, 2025 - MEMORY OPTIMIZATION & INVESTMENT RATIONALE

#### **🔧 MEMORY LEAK FIX**
- **Problem**: Unbounded LRU cache causing memory growth over time
- **Solution**: Custom TTL-based cache with automatic expiration
- **Implementation**: 
  - Replaced `@lru_cache` with custom `@ttl_cache(seconds=900, maxsize=100)`
  - Added thread-safe implementation with LRU eviction
  - Implemented cache management API endpoint `/api/clear-cache`
- **Results**: Memory bounded, 15-minute data freshness, manual cache control

#### **💡 INVESTMENT RATIONALE GENERATION**
- **Problem**: Stock detail pages showing "Loading investment analysis..." indefinitely
- **Solution**: Generated comprehensive investment rationales from available data
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `generateRationale()` function using stock scores
  - Includes investment summary, technical/fundamental/sentiment analysis
  - Trading strategy and risk warnings based on data
- **Results**: Professional investment summaries for all stocks

### Earlier Development - CORE ARCHITECTURE

#### **📊 5-PHASE ANALYSIS PIPELINE COMPLETE**
- **Phase 1**: Stock discovery and filtering
- **Phase 2**: Technical analysis (RSI, MACD, moving averages)
- **Phase 3**: Fundamental analysis (revenue, earnings, ratios)
- **Phase 4**: Sentiment analysis (news, social media)
- **Phase 5**: Final rankings with exit strategies

#### **🌐 LIVE MARKET DATA INTEGRATION**
- **yfinance API**: Real-time market data with rate limiting protection
- **TTL Cache**: 15-minute cache prevents API abuse
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Async data fetching
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when API unavailable

#### **🔒 ENTERPRISE SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION**
