- [ ] **User Guide** - How to use the analysis system
- [ ] **Developer Guide** - Setup and development instructions
- [ ] **Architecture Documentation** - System design and data flow

## Current System Status ‚úÖ

- **Enterprise-grade**: 5-phase analysis pipeline working
- **Live Data**: TTL cache with 15-minute refresh  
- **Memory Fixed**: Bounded cache prevents memory leaks
- **Web Interface**: Flask app at http://localhost:8080
- **Security**: Input validation and XSS protection implemented
- **Native Packaging**: macOS app build system ready

## Notes

- System currently operates without user accounts (single-user mode)
- JSON file storage suitable for current scale but won't scale to multi-user
- Legal compliance critical before any public deployment
- Testing infrastructure needed before major feature additions
