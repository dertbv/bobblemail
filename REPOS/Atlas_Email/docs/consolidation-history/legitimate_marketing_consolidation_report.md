## Key Decisions Made

1. **Excluded Investment Newsletters**: Many financial/investment newsletter domains were left in Commercial Spam as they appeared to be investment scams rather than legitimate financial services.

2. **Spoofed Domains Avoided**: Domains like "mail.amazon.s5577.pressure.uk.net" were correctly left as spam/dangerous as they are clearly spoofed.

3. **Focus on Known Brands**: Only consolidated emails from verifiably legitimate companies with proper domain authentication.

## Impact on 4-Category System
The consolidation strengthens the distinction between:
- **Commercial Spam**: Unsolicited bulk marketing from unknown/unverified sources
- **Legitimate Marketing**: Marketing from known, established companies with proper sender authentication
