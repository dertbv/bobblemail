# MOE - ORCHESTRATOR REPORT

## Investigation Summary

### Issues Identified

1. **Missing Geographic Data**: The report page is not displaying geographic/country-based spam analytics
2. **Missing "Remove Last Import" Button**: The button for removing the last import is not present on the page
3. **Duplicate Data Loading**: The page is loading last import info twice - once from backend template and once via JavaScript API call
4. **Missing Data in Template**: Several data points are not being passed to the template:
   - Preserved categories breakdown
   - Preservation reasons
   - Geographic data
   - Confidence score distribution (currently mocked with zeros)

### Root Causes

1. **Geographic Data**: Not included in any database queries - need to add geographic analytics queries
2. **Remove Button**: Simply not implemented in the template
3. **Template Data**: The backend is not passing all required data to the template:
   - `preserved_categories` is queried but not passed to template
   - `preservation_reasons` is queried but not passed to template
   - Geographic data queries are completely missing
   - Confidence stats are hardcoded to zeros

### Current Data Flow

1. Backend queries for:
   - Last session info
   - Total stats (emails, deleted, preserved)
   - Deleted categories breakdown
   - Preserved categories breakdown (NOT PASSED TO TEMPLATE)
   - Preservation reasons (NOT PASSED TO TEMPLATE)

2. Template displays:
   - Session info (account, time, duration)
   - Total statistics cards
   - Deleted categories breakdown
   - Confidence stats (HARDCODED ZEROS)
   - Validation stats
   - Category pie chart
   - JavaScript-loaded last import info (DUPLICATE)

### Recommendations for Larry

1. **Add Geographic Data Queries**: Query processed_emails_bulletproof for country/geographic data
2. **Pass Missing Data to Template**: Include preserved_categories and preservation_reasons in template context
3. **Add Real Confidence Stats**: Query actual confidence scores instead of hardcoded zeros
4. **Add Remove Last Import Button**: Add button at bottom of report page
5. **Remove Duplicate API Call**: Either use backend data OR JavaScript API, not both

### Recommendations for Curly

1. Test all 7 report sections display correctly with real data
2. Verify geographic data displays properly
3. Test "Remove Last Import" button functionality
4. Ensure no JavaScript errors on page load
5. Verify responsive design on mobile devices
