    ↓
4. Authentication Checks (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
    ↓
5. Subcategory Tagging
    ↓

## 2. Machine Learning Classification {#ml-classification}

### 2.1 Four-Category System
The ML classifier categorizes emails into 4 primary categories:

| Category | Description | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------------|-------|------------|
| **Commercial Spam** | Marketing, promotions, sales | 3,516 | 50.2% |
| **Legitimate Marketing** | Real newsletters, business communications | 1,664 | 23.8% |

| **Scams** | Financial fraud, fake prizes | 173 | 2.5% |

### 2.2 ML Models Used
- **Primary**: Four-Category Classifier (Random Forest)
- **Ensemble**: Combination of Naive Bayes + Random Forest + Keywords
- **Feature Extraction**: 73 features including:
  - Text features (TF-IDF vectorization)
  - Domain age and reputation
  - Email structure analysis
  - Header anomalies
  - Character distribution

### 2.3 A/B Testing System

## 3. Keyword and Pattern Matching {#keyword-matching}

### 3.1 Keyword Processor Components
1. **Two-Factor Validation System**
   - Primary keywords (high confidence)
   - Secondary validation patterns
   - Contextual analysis

2. **Smart Regex Selection**
   - Pre-compiled regex patterns for performance
   - Domain-specific patterns
   - Unicode and special character handling

3. **Category-Specific Keywords**
   ```python
   Financial: ['investment', 'bitcoin', 'crypto', 'retire', 'fund']
   Health: ['weight loss', 'diet', 'medical', 'diabetes', 'pills']
   Adult: ['xxx', '18+', 'adult', 'dating', 'singles']
   Phishing: ['verify account', 'suspended', 'click here', 'urgent']
   ```

### 3.2 Pattern Recognition
- **Emoji patterns**: Excessive use of 💰🎁🔥 indicates spam
- **ALL CAPS subjects**: Higher spam probability
- **Special characters**: Unusual ASCII art or symbols
- **Number patterns**: Phone numbers, prices, percentages

---

## 4. Domain Validation {#domain-validation}

### 4.1 Domain Checks
- **Age verification**: Domains <90 days old = suspicious
- **WHOIS data**: Hidden registration = red flag
- **DNS records**: Missing or suspicious records
- **SSL certificates**: Invalid or missing HTTPS

### 4.2 Domain Reputation
- Known spam domains blacklist
- Legitimate business domain whitelist (disabled per user requirement)
- Similar domain detection (typosquatting)
- Top-level domain (TLD) risk scoring

### 4.3 Sender Spoofing Detection
```
Examples detected:
- Apple.com@spammer.ru (fake Apple)
- noreply@amaz0n.com (zero instead of 'o')
- security@paypaI.com (capital 'I' instead of 'l')
```

---

## 5. Email Authentication {#email-authentication}

### 5.1 SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
- Verifies sender IP is authorized
- **Pass**: -5% spam confidence
- **Fail**: +20% spam confidence
- **SoftFail**: +10% spam confidence

### 5.2 DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
- Cryptographic signature verification
- **Valid**: -10% spam confidence
- **Invalid**: +15% spam confidence
- **Missing**: +5% spam confidence

### 5.3 DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)
- Policy enforcement
- Alignment checking
- Quarantine/reject recommendations

### 5.4 Authentication Impact
```
Example confidence adjustments:
- All pass (SPF+DKIM+DMARC): -20% total
- All fail: +40% total
- Mixed results: Weighted calculation
```
