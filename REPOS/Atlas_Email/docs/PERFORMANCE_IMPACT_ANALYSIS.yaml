  critical_insights:
    performance_paradox:
      finding: "Authentication-first is 73% SLOWER than current pipeline"
      reason: "Current pipeline smartly avoids expensive operations for obvious cases"
      details:
        - "45% of emails are obvious spam handled in 2ms"
        - "Auth-first forces 25ms minimum for ALL emails"
        - "Domain validation adds 20ms overhead universally"
    
    misclassification_root_cause:
      not_performance: "Performance optimization isn't causing misclassification"
      actual_issues:
        - "TWO-FACTOR bypass at 0.65 confidence skips legitimate services"
        - "Domain length threshold (15 chars) too restrictive"
        - "Content patterns weighted too heavily vs authentication signals"
        - "Legitimate services without business prefixes get misclassified"

        impact: "Ensures all uncertain emails get proper validation"

      - action: "Fix domain length threshold from 15 to 30 chars"

        performance_cost: "None - just a constant change"
      
      - action: "Add authentication signal to logical classifier"

    final_recommendation: |
      The current pipeline is already highly optimized for performance.
      Authentication-first would actually HURT performance significantly.
      Instead, surgically add authentication signals where needed most -
      for uncertain emails (confidence 0.5-0.8) where misclassification occurs.
      This maintains blazing fast performance while fixing accuracy issues.
