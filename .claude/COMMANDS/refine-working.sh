Use the incremental_refine tool with this prompt:

$TASK

Context:
- Need comprehensive solution with implementation details
- Must include performance considerations
- Production-ready approach required

Requirements:
- Detailed implementation plan
- Code examples and architecture
- Performance analysis
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Testing and validation approach
- Monitoring and metrics

Output Requirements:
1. Show refinement metrics:
   - Number of iterations
   - Quality score for each iteration
   - Similarity scores between iterations
   - Convergence status and reason
   - Final quality score
2. Provide the refined deliverable with all sections needed for implementation
