# ü§ñ Enhanced Six Agent System

Advanced autonomous and parallel execution for the six-agent development workflow with intelligent coordination and quality control.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Fast autonomous mode (recommended)
./agent-enhanced.sh -f "implement user authentication system"

# Standard usage with options
./agent-enhanced.sh [OPTIONS] "task description"
```

## Execution Modes

### üöÄ **Fast Mode** (`-f`, `--fast`) - RECOMMENDED
Combines autonomous progression with parallel execution for maximum efficiency.

```bash
./agent-enhanced.sh -f "refactor email processing pipeline"
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ No human confirmations required
- ‚úÖ Parallel execution where beneficial
- ‚úÖ Auto-iteration for quality < 90%

**Best for:** Most development tasks, feature implementation, refactoring

---

### ü§ñ **Autonomous Mode** (`-a`, `--autonomous`)
Sequential execution without human confirmation.

```bash
./agent-enhanced.sh -a "implement OAuth authentication"
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ No confirmations between phases
- ‚úÖ Sequential agent progression
- ‚úÖ Self-iteration for quality control
- ‚úÖ Predictable execution order

**Best for:** Well-defined tasks, standard implementations, bug fixes

---

### ‚ö° **Parallel Mode** (`-p`, `--parallel`)
Concurrent execution with human oversight.

```bash
./agent-enhanced.sh -p "add real-time notifications"
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Compatible tasks run simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Faster than sequential execution
- ‚úÖ Human confirmation at key points
- ‚úÖ Better resource utilization

**Best for:** Complex projects requiring oversight, experimental features

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Conservative Mode** (`-c`, `--conservative`) - DEFAULT
Traditional sequential execution with manual confirmations.

```bash
./agent-enhanced.sh -c "analyze security vulnerabilities"
./agent-enhanced.sh "analyze security vulnerabilities"  # same as -c
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Human oversight at each phase
- ‚úÖ Course correction opportunities
- ‚úÖ Educational value (see decision process)
- ‚úÖ Maximum control

**Best for:** Critical systems, learning, high-risk changes

## Execution Workflow

### Fast Mode Workflow

    A[PLANNER] --> B[EXECUTER]
    A --> C[TESTER - Framework]
    A --> D[DOCUMENTER - Templates]
    B --> E[TESTER - Implementation Tests]
    B --> F[DOCUMENTER - Code Docs]
    E --> G[VERIFIER]
    F --> G
    G --> H[REPORTER]
```

### Conservative Mode Workflow

    C -->|Manual Confirm| D[DOCUMENTER]
    D -->|Manual Confirm| E[VERIFIER]
    E -->|Manual Confirm| F[REPORTER]
```

## Agent Coordination

### Sequential Dependencies (Always)
- **PLANNER** ‚Üí Must complete WORK.md before others start
- **VERIFIER** ‚Üí Requires all components for final validation
- **REPORTER** ‚Üí Needs complete picture for summary

### Parallel Opportunities
- **TESTER** can start test frameworks while EXECUTER implements
- **DOCUMENTER** can document completed components incrementally
- **EXECUTER** can work on independent modules simultaneously

### Autonomous Triggers

Each agent automatically triggers the next when work meets quality threshold (‚â•90%):

```bash
# Example auto-triggers
PLANNER: "EXECUTER: Implementation tasks ready in WORK.md. Begin immediately."
EXECUTER: "TESTER: Module authentication complete. DOCUMENTER: API ready for docs."
TESTER: "All tests passing. VERIFIER: Implementation ready for validation."
```

## Quality Control

### Autonomous Quality Gates
- **Code Quality**: No critical issues, follows project patterns
- **Test Coverage**: >90% with meaningful tests
- **Documentation**: Complete and accurate
- **Security**: No vulnerabilities introduced
- **Performance**: Meets or exceeds baselines

### Auto-Iteration Rules
- Quality < 90% ‚Üí Self-iterate with specific improvements
- Test failures ‚Üí Fix and re-test automatically
- Integration issues ‚Üí Resolve and re-validate
- Maximum 2 iteration cycles per agent

## Usage Examples

```

## File Organization

### Worktree Structure
```
/Agents/agent-[task]-[mode]-[timestamp]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AGENT_MISSION.md           # Generated mission specification
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ WORK.md                    # Coordination hub (created by PLANNER)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *AGENT*.md                 # Agent definition files

## Advanced Usage

### Environment Requirements
- Git repository (for worktree creation)
- tmux (session management)
- Claude CLI with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- Agent definition files (`*AGENT*.md`)

### Error Recovery
```bash
# If agents get stuck, check current status
tmux capture-pane -t [session] -p

# Provide clarification
tmux send-keys -t [session] "Continue with implementation of authentication module" Enter

# Force next agent (if needed)
tmux send-keys -t [session] "EXECUTER: Begin implementation phase now" Enter
```

### Cleanup After Completion
```bash
# Copy results to main repository
cp -r [worktree-path]/implementation/* ./src/
cp -r [worktree-path]/tests/* ./tests/
cp -r [worktree-path]/docs/* ./docs/

# Remove worktree and session
git worktree remove [worktree-path] --force
tmux kill-session -t [session-name]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Agents waiting for confirmation in autonomous mode:**
- Verify mission file includes autonomous instructions
- Check WORK.md for quality gate status
- Send explicit continue command via tmux

**Parallel tasks not starting:**
- Ensure PLANNER has completed WORK.md
- Check agent dependencies in mission file
- Verify sufficient system resources

**Quality iterations stuck:**
- Review failing quality criteria
- Check test output for specific failures
- Provide additional context via tmux

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check mission configuration
cat [worktree-path]/AGENT_MISSION.md | grep -A 5 "EXECUTION MODE"

# View agent progress
grep -r "Agent:" [worktree-path]/ | tail -10

# Check quality scores
grep -r "Score\|Quality\|Threshold" [worktree-path]/
```

## Tips for Success

### Mode Selection Strategy
- üöÄ **Use Fast Mode** for 80% of development tasks
- ü§ñ **Use Autonomous** for simple, well-defined work
- ‚ö° **Use Parallel** for complex projects needing speed
- üõ°Ô∏è **Use Conservative** for critical or experimental changes

### Task Description Best Practices
- Be specific about requirements and constraints
- Include context about existing systems
- Mention performance or security requirements
- Specify preferred technologies or approaches

### Quality Optimization
- Let agents complete their quality iterations
- Monitor WORK.md for coordination status
- Trust the autonomous quality gates
- Intervene only when agents are truly stuck
