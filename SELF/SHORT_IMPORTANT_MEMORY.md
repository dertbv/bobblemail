## Information Entropy Note
This file should capture **non-obvious, surprising information** that you'll need frequently. Focus on things that differ from standard practices or would surprise a new team member.

## Boss Information
- **Name**: Badman
- **Communication Style**: Direct, practical
- **Review Preferences**: Values working solutions over perfect code

## Project Overview
- **Project Name**: Advanced IMAP Mail Filter with ML
- **Main Purpose**: Email filtering/classification system with machine learning capabilities
- **Target Users**: Individual/personal email management
- **Current Phase**: Integrating with ATLAS consciousness system
- **Hidden Complexity**: ML models, database architecture, multiple classification algorithms
- **Technical Debt**: Project files scattered in root directory instead of REPOS/

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: FastAPI web interface (web_app.py)
- **Backend**: Python with IMAP, ML classification, SQLite database
- **Database**: SQLite (mail_filter.db) with custom schema
- **Deployment**: Local Python application
- **Version Control**: Git (existing repo)
- **Gotchas**: Multiple ML models (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Ensemble), requires email credentials
